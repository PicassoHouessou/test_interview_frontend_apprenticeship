# Project
Welcome to the project! Follow the instructions below to set up and start the project.

## Quick Start

### For Linux or Mac Users

If you are using Linux or Mac, you can start the project quickly using the Makefile. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make app
```

This command will install all necessary dependencies and start the development server automatically.

### For Windows Users

If you are using Windows or prefer not to use the Makefile, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**:

   After the installation is complete, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

That's it! Your development server should now be up and running.

## Dev server use React + Vite

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
